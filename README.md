## Usage

How Authup can be configured and set up in detail, you can find out [here](https://authup.org/guide/deployment/).

### Docker

The **recommended** and optimal way to set up authup is using docker.

To run the backend application with default settings on http://localhost:3001/, execute the following command:

```shell
$ docker run \
  -v authup:/usr/src/writable \
  -p 3001:3000 \
  authup/authup:latest server/core start
```

To run the frontend application with default settings on http://localhost:3000/, execute the following command:

```shell
$ docker run \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  authup/authup:latest client/web start
```

### Bare Metal

The easiest way to get the framework up and running, is by using the global CLI.
Therefore, execute the following shell command.

```shell
$ npx authup@latest start
```

To find out how to configure and set up the bare metal variant in detail, click here.

This will lunch the following application with default settings:
- Frontend Application: `http://localhost:3000/`
- Backend Application: `http://localhost:3001/`
